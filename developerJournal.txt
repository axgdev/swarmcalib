We can set internal and external zones with check values to see how the copter position has changed.

What do the calibration parameters look like in the arena: 
___________________________
|          +theta          |
|           |              |
|   +phi____|_____-phi     |
|           |              |

|   Green copter part      |

P=0.175
I=0.000001
D=0

Maybe replace the prints of python to the log function, as it allows us
to add timestamps to the messages automatically

-To turn the leds easily, just lift the copter to make it think its in air
We have to modify the start mode not to turn off the leds. Or maybe is the
unkilling doing that.
-fix indentation ivyCalibrationNode
